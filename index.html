This is a web-page for collating useful tools, data and resources for veterinary genomics and metagenomics, focusing on farmed (cattle, chicken, pigs, sheep, fish etc) and companion (dog, cat, horse etc) animals.

The page is run by the [Watson Group](https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/about/contact-us/staff/mick-watson) at [The Roslin Institute](https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin) and [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)

We are building the site over time, so please check back regularly.  Use the "resources" menu at the top of the page to navigate, or the buttons below to contact us.
